## Introduction

This is an overview of the top donors and recipients of foreign aid since the year 2000.

Foreign aid is the voluntary transfer of capital, goods or services from one country to another, given by governments of richer countries to promote the economic development of poorer countries and the welfare of their people.

The most widely used measure of foreign aid is *Official Development Assistance* (ODA).  

Most ODA is in the form of grants, but some is measured as the concessional value in soft (low-interest) loans.

**Datasource**: From the stats library of the Organization For Economic Co-Operation And Development (OECD)

## Top Recipients of ODA by Dollar Value

Most of the top recipients in the last few years have been Middle Eastern Countries, Oil Producing Countries or countries in the midst of war.

## Top Recipients of ODA by % of GNI

A better measure of ODA on recipients is how much it contributes to the country's GNI % (ie percentage of Gross National Income).

The chart below shows which country's ODA went the furthest in contributing to their Gross National Income for that year.  These are mostly countries in the midst of / recovering from war, or very small and remote island states like Tuvalu in the South Pacific.

## Top Donors of ODA

The United States donates the most ODA in terms of dollar value.

But the United States is not the biggest donor in terms of % of GNI.  Biggest donors in terms of % of GNI are European countries and the UAE.  They donate the most of their GNI to other countries.

## Closer to Home

Canada's ODA donations have been generally increasing in the past 20 years.

Canada is part of the DAC member of countries.  DAC stands for Development Assistance Committee.  Our biggest donation in one year has been to Haiti during the 2010 earthquake.
